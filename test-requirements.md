# User Authentication System

## Overview
Users need secure login/logout functionality with email and password authentication to access personalized features and protect user data.

## Business Objectives
- Enable user personalization and customized experiences
- Protect sensitive user data and maintain privacy
- Meet security compliance requirements (GDPR, SOC 2)
- Reduce support tickets related to account access
- Enable user analytics and behavior tracking

## Functional Requirements
- Email validation on user registration
- Password strength requirements (minimum 8 characters, special characters)
- "Remember me" functionality for persistent sessions
- Password reset via email verification
- Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts
- User session management and timeout
- Social login integration (Google, Microsoft)
- Two-factor authentication support

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Email validation displays real-time feedback during registration
- [ ] Password strength indicator shows requirements and progress
- [ ] "Forgot password" sends reset link within 2 minutes
- [ ] Account lockout triggers after 5 failed attempts and notifies user
- [ ] Sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity
- [ ] Social login redirects properly and syncs user data
- [ ] 2FA setup is optional but recommended to users
- [ ] All authentication events are logged for security audit

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Authentication response time under 2 seconds
- 99.9% uptime for authentication services
- Password encryption using industry standards (bcrypt, Argon2)
- HTTPS required for all authentication endpoints
- Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Compliance with OWASP authentication guidelines

## Priority: High

## Dependencies
- User database schema design
- Email service integration (SendGrid/AWS SES)
- SSL certificate configuration
- Identity provider integrations (OAuth providers)

## Risks and Assumptions
### Risks
- Security vulnerabilities in authentication flow
- Third-party OAuth service downtime
- Password reset email delivery issues
- Performance impact of security measures

### Assumptions
- Users have access to email for account verification
- Third-party OAuth services maintain stable APIs
- Existing infrastructure can handle authentication load
- Legal team approves data collection for analytics
