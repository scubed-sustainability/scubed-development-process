## Prompt for Claude

I want to build {project_info['description']}. Help me define:

1. **Core Problem Analysis**
   - What specific problem does this solve?
   - Who are the primary users affected by this problem?
   - How is this problem currently being solved (if at all)?
   - What are the pain points with current solutions?

2. **Success Definition**
   - What does success look like (measurable outcomes)?
   - What are the key performance indicators (KPIs)?
   - What would make users choose this over alternatives?

3. **Scope Boundaries**
   - What are the must-have features for MVP?
   - What should be explicitly excluded from scope?
   - What are the key assumptions that need validation?

4. **Risk Assessment**
   - What could prevent this project from succeeding?
   - What technical risks should we be aware of?
   - What market/business risks exist?

Please provide structured output suitable for documentation and stakeholder review.

## Context
Project: {project_info['name']}
Description: {project_info['description']}

## Prompt for Claude

For a {project_info['type']} application focused on {project_info['description']}, generate comprehensive user stories that cover:

1. **Primary User Workflows**
   - Core functionality that users will use daily
   - Different user types and their specific needs
   - End-to-end user journeys

2. **Administrative Functions**
   - User management and permissions
   - Configuration and settings
   - Monitoring and reporting

3. **Edge Cases and Error Scenarios**
   - What happens when things go wrong
   - Data validation and error recovery
   - Security and compliance scenarios

4. **Non-Functional Requirements**
   - Performance expectations
   - Scalability requirements
   - Security and compliance needs

Format each user story as:
**As a** [user type], **I want** [goal] **so that** [benefit]

Include acceptance criteria for each story:
- Given [context]
- When [action]
- Then [expected outcome]

Organize by priority: Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have (MoSCoW)

## Context
Project: {project_info['name']}
Type: {project_info['type']}

## Prompt for Claude

Help me create Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for {project_info['description']}. 

For each major architectural decision, provide:

**ADR Format:**
- **Title**: Brief decision description
- **Status**: Proposed/Accepted/Superseded
- **Context**: What forces are at play?
- **Decision**: What we decided to do
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier/harder

**Key Decisions to Address:**

1. **Overall Architecture Pattern**
   - Monolithic vs Microservices vs Modular Monolith
   - Client-Server vs Serverless vs Hybrid

2. **Data Architecture**
   - Database selection (SQL vs NoSQL vs Hybrid)
   - Data modeling approach
   - Caching strategy
   - Data synchronization patterns

3. **API Design**
   - REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC
   - Authentication/authorization approach
   - Rate limiting and security

4. **Frontend Architecture**
   - SPA vs SSR vs Static Generation
   - State management approach
   - Component architecture

5. **Deployment Architecture**
   - Cloud provider and services
   - Containerization strategy
   - CI/CD pipeline design
   - Monitoring and observability

6. **Development Workflow**
   - Version control strategy
   - Testing approach
   - Code quality standards
   - Documentation standards

Consider trade-offs between development speed, maintainability, performance, and cost.

- **Probability**: How likely is this to occur? (High/Medium/Low)
- **Mitigation**: What can be done to prevent or minimize this risk?
- **Contingency**: What's the backup plan if this risk materializes?
- **Owner**: Who should monitor and manage this risk?

Prioritize risks by Impact √ó Probability matrix.
