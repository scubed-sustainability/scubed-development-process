# Requirements Template

This simplified template provides a streamlined framework for gathering essential project requirements using the S-cubed development process.

## Getting Started

1. **Open the template** - Use the S-cubed VS Code extension to apply this template to your project
2. **Fill in the placeholders** - Replace all `[placeholders]` with your actual project information
3. **Complete all 6 sections** - Each section is required for project approval
4. **Check off items** - Use the `- [ ]` checkboxes to track your progress

## Template Structure

This template contains exactly **6 required sections**:

1. **Requirement Title** - Your project name/title
2. **Requirement Summary** - Brief description of what you're building and why
3. **Business Objectives** - Specific measurable business goals and success metrics
4. **Functional Requirements** - Core features users will interact with
5. **Acceptance Criteria** - Overall project success criteria and quality gates
6. **Stakeholders** - All people who need to approve this project

## Using the Template

2. **Define business value** - Clear objectives and success metrics
3. **List core features** - Focus on user-facing functionality
4. **Set success criteria** - How you'll know the project succeeded
