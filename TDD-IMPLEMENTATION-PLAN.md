**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

## 🎯 **TDD Philosophy & Approach**

### Core Principles
- **Red → Green → Refactor** cycle for every change
- **Tests define the contract** - write tests that describe what users should experience
- **User-centric testing** - tests should verify user workflows, not implementation details
- **Fail first, succeed deliberately** - ensure tests actually catch problems

### TDD Rules We Follow
- ✅ **Never write production code without a failing test**
- ✅ **Write only enough test to fail (and not compile)**
- ✅ **Write only enough production code to make the test pass**
- ✅ **Tests must be simple, focused, and readable**
- ✅ **Production code can only be written to make tests pass**
